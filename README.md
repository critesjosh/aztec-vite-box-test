# aztec_vite_box

Trying to get a vite box react template working.

## Setup

1. `yarn`
2. Use 0.63.1 of the sandbox (`VERSION=0.63.1 aztec-up`)
3. `yarn compile`
4. `yarn codegen`
5. `cd src/ui && yarn`
6. `yarn dev` to start the dev server (should work)

The dev server is working, but `yarn build` fails.
